# Advent of Code 2019, Prolog edition

I've recently fallen hopelessly enamoured with [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), a (mostly) declarative
logic programming language, and attempting to
solving https://adventofcode.com/2019 puzzles using solely the language.
This is the second date, to see where this would lead us.

Keep in mind that this is rather personal and if you want to follow along, I'm using `SWI-Prolog version 8.1.13 for x86_64-darwin`. Hopefully
each Prolog file is self-contained and has its own instructions on how to reproduce...
